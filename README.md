# arcgis-rest-services-url-extractor
### Project Overview

This project automates the extraction of URLs containing "arcgis/rest/services" from Google search results using Selenium WebDriver. Extracted URLs are stored in both a CSV file and a MySQL database for further analysis.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Python 3.7+
   - MySQL Server

2. **Installation**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configuration**
   - Configure MySQL credentials in `extract_urls.py` (lines X-X).

### Running the Solution

To run the solution:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repository

2. Execute the Python script:
python extract_urls.py

### Usage

- The script `extract_urls.py` performs Google searches and extracts URLs containing "arcgis/rest/services".
- Extracted URLs are accumulated in `arcgis_urls_accumulated.csv`.
- They are also stored in the MySQL database `arcgis_urls_db` for permanent storage and deduplication.

### Report and Documentation

**Approach**:

1. **Automation with Selenium WebDriver**:
- Utilized Selenium to automate Google searches and navigate through multiple result pages.
- Implemented XPath queries to locate and extract URLs matching the pattern "arcgis/rest/services".

2. **Data Storage and Deduplication**:
- Saved extracted URLs to a CSV file (`arcgis_urls_accumulated.csv`) with an option to append to existing data.
- Stored URLs in a MySQL database (`arcgis_urls_db`) using Python's MySQL Connector to ensure data persistence and facilitate efficient querying.

3. **Error Handling and Robustness**:
- Implemented error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions during web scraping, such as handling page load delays and missing elements.

**Challenges**:

1. **Dynamic Web Pages**:
- Addressed challenges posed by dynamic elements on Google search result pages, ensuring reliable URL extraction across different layouts and scenarios.

2. **Database Management**:
- Managed database interactions to prevent duplicate entries, using SQL queries to check for existing URLs before insertion and ensuring data integrity.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
- Optimized script performance by tuning wait times between page loads and batch processing URLs to balance between reliability and speed.

4. **Scalability and Maintenance**:
- Considered scalability implications for handling larger datasets and ongoing maintenance needs, including periodic checks for updates in Google search behavior or website structure changes.

### Conclusion

Successfully automated the extraction and storage of URLs from Google search results using Python, Selenium WebDriver, and MySQL. The project achieved its goal of providing a robust solution for collecting and managing URLs related to "arcgis/rest/services", with recommendations for future enhancements in error handling and scalability.
